### Summary

Elevate is a fullstack, interactive web app that designs a workout plan for users based on their selections. It also provides the ability for users to add their own workouts, and to generate random workouts from their personal list.

### Technology

The front-end of this application was built using React.js. The back end was built using Node.js with Express. I used React Router for my routing.
